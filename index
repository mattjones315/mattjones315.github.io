== About Me
I am a Bioinformatics PhD candidate at UC San Francisco and UC Berkeley, advised by [https://weissmanlab.ucsf.edu/ Jonathan Weissman] and [https://niryosef.wordpress.com/ Nir Yosef]. Generally, I'm interested in studying cancer & the immune system from the perspective of high-throughput assays (mostly transcriptomics).

My current research is focused on developing suitable technologies and computational tools for studying how aggressive cancers evolve from a single transformed cell and eventually metastasize throughout a body. In this, I am the lead contributor to [https://github.com/YosefLab/Cassiopeia Cassiopeia], a software suite for reconstructing single-cell phylogenies from continuous CRISPR/Cas9 barcoding data.

In 2020, I spent the summer as a research intern at [https://research.google/teams/health/ Google Brain Genomics] working on deep learning methods for Electronic Health Record (EHR) data.

Before my PhD, I studied Computer Science at UC Berkeley and worked in the Nielsen Lab on developing simulators for large admixture events. And before that, I grew up in a small town outside of Pasadena, CA where I was a tri-sport athelete and musician.

== Beyond Science

In my downtime, you can find me engrossed in a [booklist.html book], playing guitar, or listening to my records. I often am looking for an excuse to get outside, or to travel.
