== About Me
I am a Postdoctoral Scholar at Stanford University in [https://profiles.stanford.edu/howard-chang Howard Chang's lab]. Generally, I am interested in studying how tumors evolve over time, especially under various pressures exerted by the immune system and therapies. My work typically takes advantage of high-throughput sequencing assays (e.g., scRNA-seq), lineage-tracing technologies, and new computational tools and inference techniques.

My current research focuses on understanding how distinct lineages, at the molecular and cellular level, are interwoven in tumor progression, and how this relates to therapeutic resistance. Previously, I developed single-cell evolving lineage tracing technologies and computational tools.  In this, I developed [https://github.com/YosefLab/Cassiopeia Cassiopeia], a software suite for reconstructing single-cell phylogenies from continuous CRISPR/Cas9 barcoding data. We used these tools to study how aggressive cancers evolve from a single transformed cell and eventually metastasize throughout a body.

In 2020, I spent the summer as a research intern at [https://research.google/teams/health/ Google Brain Genomics] working on deep learning methods for Electronic Health Record (EHR) data.

Previously, I completed my PhD in Bioinformatics at UC San Francisco and UC Berkeley advised by [https://weissman.wi.mit.edu/ Jonathan Weissman] and [https://yoseflab.github.io/ Nir Yosef]. Before my graduate work, I studied Computer Science at UC Berkeley and worked in the [https://nielsen-lab.github.io/ Nielsen Lab] on developing simulators for large admixture events. And before that, I grew up in a small town outside of Pasadena, CA where I was a tri-sport athelete and musician.

== Beyond Science

In my downtime, you can find me engrossed in a [booklist.html book], playing guitar, or listening to my records. I often am looking for an excuse to get outside, or to travel.
